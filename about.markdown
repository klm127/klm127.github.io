I'm a 30-something Computer Science student aspiring to be a full-time developer. As of this writing, I'm in the very early (sub 1 year) part of my journey, but my progress has been rapid. My ultimate goal is to be a member of a productive team where I can contribute real value. I also hope to work remotely, as I intend to start a small homestead with my wife. 


**interests**: coding, reading, nature, homesteading, fitness

**languages**: javascript, Ruby (early stages of learning), Java, a little C#(for scripts in Space Engineers!)
