I'm a nontraditional Computer Science student aspiring to become a full-time developer. I'm in the final year of my journey and I like to think my progress has been rapid. My ultimate goal is to be gainfully employed as a member of a productive team where I can contribute real value and learn from masters.

This page is to document my progress. It's purpose is to reflect on my development activites keep me accountable. I hope to be able to look back and enjoy seeing the progress I make.
