I'm a 30-something Computer Science student aspiring to be a full-time developer. I'm in the second year of my journey and I like to think my progress has been rapid. My ultimate goal is to be gainfully employed as a member of a productive team where I can contribute real value. Down the line, I hope to find a path to development related entrepreneurship.

This page is to document my progress. It's purpose is to write about my coding activites as a learning exercise and to keep me accountable. I hope to be able to look back and enjoy seeing the progress I make.
