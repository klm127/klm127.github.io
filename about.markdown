I'm a 30-something Computer Science student aspiring to be a full-time developer. As of this writing, I'm in the very early (sub 1 year) part of my journey, but I like to think my progress has been rapid. My ultimate goal is to be gainfully employed as a member of a productive team where I can contribute real value. Down the line, I aspire to find a path to development related entrepreneurship.
