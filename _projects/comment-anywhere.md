This was my senior project. It allows users to post comments on any website on the internet through a web extension.

The front end is a browser extension written in Typescript and packed with Vite. The back end is a web server written in Go connected to a Postgres database. I designed the project last semester and am implementing it this semester. I am working with two other students. I am implementing the back end portion and assisting them with the front end. 

The project is complete, but we chose not to launch it at this time.
