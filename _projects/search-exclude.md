There were two reasons I made this project. First, I wanted to get familiar with browser extensions because my senior project front end is a browser extension. Second, I am tired of seeing the same terrible sites high in my search results. I don't want to see chegg, geeksforgeeks, or javatpoint ever again if I can help it. And I can!

The extension basically works. It loads, it saves your exclusion categories and site lists, and it excludes, though there are probably still some bugs. It works mostly by fooling around with query strings. It's near completion, but I haven't released it to the extension store, mostly because I am not satisfied with the styling and it hasn't been tested thoroughly enough. I will finish and release it at some point this year.
