I am creating Listing Lad with a friend who is a Boston-area real-estate agent. It will be a subscription based service marketed to real-estate professionals. Using a web extension front-end, automates the posting of sets of rentals to Facebook marketplace and, eventually, Zillow.

I have a simple website and database running with a few admin tools. My next step is to finish the user sign up and subscription process. After that, I will build out the web extension portion and my business partner will market it.
