I created this simulator to solidify my understanding of Physics formulas and concepts and to explore some programming technologies. It has gravity, collisions, air resistance, and orbits. The GUI is made in tkinter. It's fun seeing how many bouncing squares you can add before you crash the interpreter. I picked python because it was the primary language taught at that university and I hoped to find collaborators, but it's not the best language for the job and I have little interest in adding more features. It's arguably complete, but it really serves no purpose other than to demonstrate that I can write python code.
