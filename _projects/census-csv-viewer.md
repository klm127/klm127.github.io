I created cencus-csv-parser while exploring choropleth data visualizations. I had acquired U.S. census data, which is distributed in massive, magnificent, but hideous CSVs. I needed a tool to parse these csvs into json objects that better captured the structure of the data. I also explored unit testing for the first time and used test-driven development throughout, which resulted in a solid and reliable project. I released it on npm, where it has gotten around 1000 downloads. I have no plans for further features and consider the project complete.
