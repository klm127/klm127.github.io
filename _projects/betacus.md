The owner of the company I interned at had a passion side project called Betacus. He had been collecting data on horse racing results and making predictions for many years. He had a website and a few subscribers. The website was broken, and he asked me to take a look. I wound up rebuilding it from scratch.

I also built a scraper in Go to reduce data entry time. As of this writing, no subscription is required to access Betacus, so [check it out](https://www.betacus.com) while it's free. 

I made a [post about Betacus](/betacus) going into more detail.
