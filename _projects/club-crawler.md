Club-crawler is a dungeon crawler style javascript web game made with [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) similar to the arcade classic [Gauntlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauntlet_(1985_video_game)).

I created this project while president of the UNHM Programming Club. I had hoped to get other members of the club to participate with me on it but it wound up just being me.

In the future, I may revisit this project and refactor it into typescript, as well as add more content. I think it has good bones, but it needs to be built out.
