This was my final project for Systems Fundamentals at University of New Hampshire, Manchester. It consists of a vintage flight joystick handle I found on eBay, an accelerometer hot-glued to the inside, 6 wires soldered to an ethernet cable, and a Raspberry Pi and breadboard.

By pitching, yawing, and rolling the joystick, one can pitch, yaw, and roll a selected 3D object in Blender 2.7.9 running on a Raspberry Pi.

Originally, I planned for the project to include two more 3d-printed housings, to be strapped on the wrist and elbow area, which would capture complex arm motion for animation or game purposes, but I scaled the project down as deadlines approached.

Iâ€™m proud of the project, as I gained proficiency in areas I was new in, namely, low-level communications (like i2C), reading spec sheets, soldering, writing addons for Blender, matrices, and 3D generally.
