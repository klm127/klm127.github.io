ReadWriteDisplayTriangles was the project where I first decided that I wanted to switch majors and devote myself to programming. I took a Java Programming course as an elective while finishing up my A.S. in Paralegal Studies in 2020. I loved Java, and I went way overboard on this midterm project for the class requirements. I coded it all in notepad++ somehow. It's ugly, but it works, it's kind of cool, and it's where I really started.
