Scaf is general purpose, command line, project initialization tool.

Scaf is purpose-agnostic and can be used to start-up ("scaffold") any type of project that has a directory structure.

Scaf works by maintaining directories of templates that the user supplies. When the user wants to scaffold a new project, they may use scaf to copy the contents from one of these directories into their current directory.
